From January to April 1st, 2020:

After reading into the subject, the first order of magnitude calculations were made based on reco_estimate.py and theory.py by Maarten.
I followed these, then ran my own first simulations. First results showed that we needed a lot more data for Bc+ and Ds+ events.
As these events have a lot lower efficiency than B+ or D+ decays. Therefore we ended up choosing to simulate 1.0E8 events of each,
to keep the relative efficiencies correct. They were cut on FD > 15 mm & 2 < eta < 5. First analysis was written under Data/rapidsim_analysis.doc.
To properly visualize data, dictionaries of 0 hit or 1+ hit data were pickled and saved, in order to plot them offline.
While running the simulations, original efficiencies turned out to deviate from own current results. To investigate, simulated test tree.root,
and found that Maarten's and my script get the same efficiencies, but different from the previous result. To investigate further,
we decided to run another test simulation for B+ -> (J/psi(1S) -> mu+ mu-) + K+, since that result is well known. To be continued.

 - Wondered why the Bc+ channel would be such a good candidate for this whole chargedB-tracking business. Final state is very clean: i.e. no colour charge.
   But doesn't the same hold for B+ decays? We'll have to find out. 

For now graphing: parent_comp, daughter_comp and hit_comp and efficiency check are on the to-do list.

Week 15 - April 6 to April 10:

Figures done, but J/Psi(1S) is not supported in RapidSim, so we might look at another decay instead. Correction: J/Psi(1S) == J/Psi
Also, following variables should be in root file:  Bp_BTracking_nVeloSensors = 0. Checked var, yielded an efficiency of 0.068 percent,
our scripts yielded double from RapidSim, at 0.138 percent. Original in theory: 0.314 percent. NO CLUE.
Now checking FD distributions (and eta's, if possible). Seem to be very similar. P, PT also
Coming back to efficiencies: not everything was run 2. Now it is, and .root benchmark has double the efficiency of our scripts. eta-range from 2 - 5 helps somewhat.

Week 16 - April 13 - April 17:

Spent time on presentation for KVI. Been comparing Full Simulation files to the Rapid Sim files, and trying to make them match by taking into account PT > 500Mev,
IPCHI2 and FDCHI2 cuts. Unclear on how to proceed right now, considering cutting on P first and see how close we get.
