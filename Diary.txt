From January to April 1st, 2020:

After reading into the subject, the first order of magnitude calculations were made based on reco_estimate.py and theory.py by Maarten.
I followed these, then ran my own first simulations. First results showed that we needed a lot more data for Bc+ and Ds+ events.
As these events have a lot lower efficiency than B+ or D+ decays. Therefore we ended up choosing to simulate 1.0E8 events of each,
to keep the relative efficiencies correct. They were cut on FD > 15 mm & 2 < eta < 5. First analysis was written under Data/rapidsim_analysis.doc.
To properly visualize data, dictionaries of 0 hit or 1+ hit data were pickled and saved, in order to plot them offline.
While running the simulations, original efficiencies turned out to deviate from own current results. To investigate, simulated test tree.root,
and found that Maarten's and my script get the same efficiencies, but different from the previous result. To investigate further,
we decided to run another test simulation for B+ -> (J/psi(1S) -> mu+ mu-) + K+, since that result is well known. To be continued.

 - Wondered why the Bc+ channel would be such a good candidate for this whole chargedB-tracking business. Final state is very clean: i.e. no colour charge.
   But doesn't the same hold for B+ decays? We'll have to find out. 

For now graphing: parent_comp, daughter_comp and hit_comp and efficiency check are on the to-do list.

Week 15 - April 6 to April 10:

Figures done, but J/Psi(1S) is not supported in RapidSim, so we might look at another decay instead. Correction: J/Psi(1S) == J/Psi
Also, following variables should be in root file:  Bp_BTracking_nVeloSensors = 0. Checked var, yielded an efficiency of 0.068 percent,
our scripts yielded double from RapidSim, at 0.138 percent. Original in theory: 0.314 percent. NO CLUE.
Now checking FD distributions (and eta's, if possible). Seem to be very similar. P, PT also
Coming back to efficiencies: not everything was run 2. Now it is, and full_sim benchmark has double the efficiency of our scripts.

Week 16 - April 13 - April 17:

Spent time on presentation for KVI. Been comparing Full Simulation files to the Rapid Sim files, and trying to make them match by taking into account PT > 500Mev,
IPCHI2 and FDCHI2 cuts. Unclear on how to proceed right now, considering cutting on P first and see how close we get.

Week 17 - April 20 - April 24:

Made a Root Macro, as IRoot didn't work out so well. Plotted the differences for FS/RS, are significant even after the cuts. Not sure what to aim for right now.
Getting the distributions right, or just continue working with RapidSim, or trying to get a Full sim for the Bc+ decay.
Meeting Maarten: First of all we have to check RapidSim vs. FullSim better with new simulation we will be getting. Secondly, there is a couple of variables
Maarten showed me in B+ -> J/Psi decays that I have to familiarize myself with to be able to find the B+ VELO hits myself. Especially PatRec->nHits & PatRec->nSensors,
TrkFit->Eta & TrkFit->Phi. To determine the angle for B+ vs K+, mup, mum.
Also note we DON'T look at B+ because they are very precisely produced in e+e- beams in e.g. BBbar and Belle experiments. Bc+ only in proton collisions!
If we want to dive back into the kinematics, probably save a tree with hits only for all 4 decays, and Analyze with ROOT. Should be easy.

Week 18 - April 28 - April 31:

Started work on two scripts: improving performance of original analysis, doing it through root, and making a script for checking out track-fit variables.
Maarten's full_sim files didn't contain the variables yet, so fixing up the kitchen right now.

Week 19 - May 4 - May 8:

Continued work on RapidSim script. We want to use qsub to run ~100 jobs, but no idea how to merge them right away, as we cannot change the name of the output file.
Should ask tomorrow. Also, don't have a cern account atm, so can't reach the very_loose trees to check full_sim vs Rapid_sim. This is also the file that will serve
to find the B hits in the VELO. So kind of stuck right now. Should probably just get something done with RapidSim.

Week 20 - May 11-15:

Figured the qsub thing out. Made a nice start, but ended having to redo it anyways as the cuts for RapidSim and FullSim were changed again. Also saw the first 
results for the TrkFit variables reconstruction resolution for the angles of B+ vs K+/mu+/mu-. Turned out FullSim mistakes B+ for K+ quite often-
especially when their momenta point in almost the same direction.

Week 21 - May 18-22:

Finally got the comparison for RapidSim/FullSim done. Looks good. The required cuts are now put into qsub simulations as we speak, and trying to get a new plot for
angle(K+, B+) without the mis-ID's. After talk with Maarten we will again try to get them closer together, so we are looking for a kinematic region where the comparison
is better still. So still no qsub runs for now. Also, looking for the angle(K+, B+) we find that the TRUEID of K+ is often 521, i.e. a B+. This is far from expected, 
but could make sense, so we will leave the K+ for now and focus on the mum and mup to get a feel for the variance of the distribution with (angle_REC - angle_TRUE) / TRUE

Week 22 - May 25-29:

Tried to get RapidSim to work with an alternative momentum distribution. Gave input histograms of both MeV and Gev distributions, but no luck. Tried the developers
who sent a very kind e-mail, but no useful tips, really. Probably going to go with the current discrepancy, might reweigh the momenta to get a more accurate figure for the
efficiency of the B-hits.

Week 23 - June 2-5:

After some deliberations together with Kristof on June 2, 3 and 4, we decided we needed to properly work out a plan with a possible analysis for Bc+ -> tau.
Therefore we will focus on the Bplus -> Jpsi (-> mumu) K+ calibration channel, and consequently on a possible normalization channel B+ -> D0 pi+. First we want to get a feel
for what BpTracking can do for us.

Week 24 - June 8-12:

Got the 2D RapidSim results, which was neat. Solved it only a slight bit. When making a full comparison of MC, MC + reco-cut, RS, RS-2D and FullSim, finally obvious
it's a reconstruction efficiency issue. Now focussing on making TProfile of nHits vs .. for the B -> Jpsi (mu+ mu-) K+ decay. looks interesting, we obvuously get hits for
high (transverse) momentum events for B+, interested to see results for daughters.

Week 45 - November 2-6:

This has been a while. Picking up the work somewhere at the start of september, I have been busy with several things. I have done some test fitting to hopefully get a fit done
for data on discerning variables (lifetime for B+ vs Bc+, opening angle, Mcorr). That went well, also tried fixing based on MC distribution. Discussed possible background channels
with Maarten - looks promising (not many). Worked on a 2d plot for fitting of nHits vs. Mcorr. Calculated Corrected mass based on PV-SV information (standard), Btracking information
- by measuring the B direction resolution, and based on MC information. B tracking is truly promising, but doesn't nearly provide enough S/B. Bottomline: we need more information.
