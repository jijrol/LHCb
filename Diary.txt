From January to April 1st, 2020:

After reading into the subject, the first order of magnitude calculations were made based on reco_estimate.py and theory.py by Maarten.
I followed these, then ran my own first simulations. First results showed that we needed a lot more data for Bc+ and Ds+ events.
As these events have a lot lower efficiency than B+ or D+ decays. Therefore we ended up choosing to simulate 1.0E8 events of each,
to keep the relative efficiencies correct. They were cut on FD > 15 mm & 2 < eta < 5. First analysis was written under Data/rapidsim_analysis.doc.
To properly visualize data, dictionaries of 0 hit or 1+ hit data were pickled and saved, in order to plot them offline.
While running the simulations, original efficiencies turned out to deviate from own current results. To investigate, simulated test tree.root,
and found that Maarten's and my script get the same efficiencies, but different from the previous result. To investigate further,
we decided to run another test simulation for B+ -> (J/psi(1S) -> mu+ mu-) + K+, since that result is well known. To be continued.

 - Wondered why the Bc+ channel would be such a good candidate for this whole chargedB-tracking business. Final state is very clean: i.e. no colour charge.
   But doesn't the same hold for B+ decays? We'll have to find out. 

For now graphing: parent_comp, daughter_comp and hit_comp and efficiency check are on the to-do list.

Week 15 - April 6 to April 10:

Figures done, but J/Psi(1S) is not supported in RapidSim, so we might look at another decay instead. Correction: J/Psi(1S) == J/Psi
Also, following variables should be in root file:  Bp_BTracking_nVeloSensors = 0. Checked var, yielded an efficiency of 0.068 percent,
our scripts yielded double from RapidSim, at 0.138 percent. Original in theory: 0.314 percent. NO CLUE.
Now checking FD distributions (and eta's, if possible). Seem to be very similar. P, PT also
Coming back to efficiencies: not everything was run 2. Now it is, and full_sim benchmark has double the efficiency of our scripts.

Week 16 - April 13 - April 17:

Spent time on presentation for KVI. Been comparing Full Simulation files to the Rapid Sim files, and trying to make them match by taking into account PT > 500Mev,
IPCHI2 and FDCHI2 cuts. Unclear on how to proceed right now, considering cutting on P first and see how close we get.

Week 17 - April 20 - April 24:

Made a Root Macro, as IRoot didn't work out so well. Plotted the differences for FS/RS, are significant even after the cuts. Not sure what to aim for right now.
Getting the distributions right, or just continue working with RapidSim, or trying to get a Full sim for the Bc+ decay.
Meeting Maarten: First of all we have to check RapidSim vs. FullSim better with new simulation we will be getting. Secondly, there is a couple of variables
Maarten showed me in B+ -> J/Psi decays that I have to familiarize myself with to be able to find the B+ VELO hits myself. Especially PatRec->nHits & PatRec->nSensors,
TrkFit->Eta & TrkFit->Phi. To determine the angle for B+ vs K+, mup, mum.
Also note we DON'T look at B+ because they are very precisely produced in e+e- beams in e.g. BBbar and Belle experiments. Bc+ only in proton collisions!
If we want to dive back into the kinematics, probably save a tree with hits only for all 4 decays, and Analyze with ROOT. Should be easy.
