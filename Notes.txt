Notes including concepts, terminology and shorthands

OZI: dependence of g_s(p) on momentum transferred. If inital en final states can be completely seperated by removing gluon lines, interaction supressed.

Dilepton mass term = (p^(mu)_1 + p^(mu)_2)^2. Bins determined by resonances mmurkying the signal.

Cabbibo suppressed: CKM matrix favours same-family interactions.
