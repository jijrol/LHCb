Notes including concepts, terminology and shorthands

OZI: dependence of g_s(p) on momentum transferred. If inital en final states can be completely seperated 
by removing gluon lines, interaction supressed.

Dilepton mass term = (p^(mu)_1 + p^(mu)_2)^2. Bins determined by resonances murkying the signal.

Cabbibo suppressed: CKM matrix favours same-family interactions.

BSM effect candidates: leptoquarks, extended Higgs sector, extended gauge sector.

Invariant mass: mass same in all reference frames (consider mass in opposite direction decays vs. same direction)

Significant difference between Muon and Electron reconstruction is large bremsstrahlung energy loss of electrons.

GIM: Mechanism that describes absence of FCNC's
