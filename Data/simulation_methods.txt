After comparing the 5 situations of simulation:
- RapidSim, 1D input histogram
- RapidSim, 2D input histogram
- Monte Carlo DCTT
- Monte Carlo DCTT with K+ mu+ mu- Reconstructed cuts
- FullSim

We can draw the conclusion that using a 2D histogram for RapidSim yields a small improvement. Still looks a lot like full MC. The big step towards FullSim is made
when Monte Carlo events are cut on being able to reconstruc, i.e. *_Reconstructed == 1. Therefore we conclude that the discrepancy is mainly due to the lower reconstruction
efficiencies at lower momenta.
